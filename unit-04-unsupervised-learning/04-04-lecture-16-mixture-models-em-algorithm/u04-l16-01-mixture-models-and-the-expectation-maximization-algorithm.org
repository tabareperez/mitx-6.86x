#+TITLE: Lecture 16 - 1: Mixture Models and the Expectation Maximization (EM) Algorithm

* OBJECTIVES
- Review Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) of mean and variance in Gaussian
  statistical model.
- Define Mixture Models.
- Understand and derive ML estimates of mean and variance of Gaussians in an
  Observed Gaussian Mixture Model.
- Understand Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate mean and
  variance of Gaussians in an Unobserved Gaussian Mixture Model.
